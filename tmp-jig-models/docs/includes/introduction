<p><code>run</code> is a software development kit (SDK) and protocol enabling arbitrary code to run on Bitcoin. It supports full object-oriented programming using JavaScript. <code>run</code> is secure and performant for real applications today. The applications can be built using jigs, interactive objects on Bitcoin. Jigs allow you to build almost anything you can dream up: tokens, contracts, interfaces, elections, games, digital pets, and more â€” all run on Bitcoin.</p>
