# Hive 
### A BSV Metanet Project

### Idea

A platform that acts as a “beehive” of connecting information - where each individual adds connections and new information or other media. Each “Hive” exists of objects (Run/Jiggs) that contain information and have pointers to other objects. Those objects can contain weblinks. If different hives connect, it might become like an interactive book that always lets you go on routes that you might want to read more about next.
